//1. Making a standard shipping box with cardstock:
/*Pattern length (L) is equal to two times the
sum of the width (W) and length (l) plus 1/2
inch for a glue flap

L = 2 x (W + l) + 1/2

Pattern Width (W) is equal to two times the
depth (D) of the box.

W = 2 x D
Side and end flaps width (FW) is equal to
one-half of the depth (D).
FW = D/2

* On small card stock boxes, a 1/2" glue tab is sufficient.
On larger boxes, a larger glue tab may be required
//L = 2 x (W + l) + 1/2*/

//Making a Simple Folded Box
//1. Make a simple folded box that is 2" wide, 3"
//long, and 1" deep.

//2. Determine the length of the card stock you
//need to make the box. The length of the card
//stock will be twice the sum of the width and
//length of the box, plus 1/2" for the glue tab.

//L = 2 x (W + l) + 1/2
//L = 2 x ( 2 + 3) + 1/2
//L = 2 x 5 + 1/2
//L = 10 + 1/2
//L = 10 1/2
